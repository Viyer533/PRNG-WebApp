# A novel pseudo-random number generator based on multivariable optimization for image-cryptographic applications
Project to implement a web app for a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) using Elliptic Curve (EC) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for image cryptographic applications. \
Based on the paper: [A novel pseudo-random number generator based on multivariable
optimization for image-cryptographic applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423029482?via%3Dihub) by Takreem Haider, Sa√∫l A. Blanco, Umar Hayat 

## Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG)
A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is a computational algorithm designed to generate sequences of numbers that appear random. However, these sequences are entirely determined by an initial value known as the seed value or key. \
With knowledge of the seed value and the algorithm used, one can reproduce the seemingly random results generated by the PRNG. Therefore, PRNGs produce sequences of numbers that are deterministic based on the initial seed value and algorithm, despite appearing random.

## Setup

1. Download and set up the [PRNS generator package](https://github.com/Viyer533/PRNG-using-ECGA)

2. Add the location of the above package to `pyproject.toml` under `tool.poetry.dependencies`

    ```bash
    prng_ecga = { path = "/path/to/parent/directory/of/package" }
    ```

3. Use `poetry` to install dependencies:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
4. Create directory `\assets` within `\prng_proj` 

## Run

1. Execute the following command to run the Web Server:

    ```bash
    poetry run python manage.py runserver
    ```
